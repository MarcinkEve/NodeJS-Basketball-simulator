# Baskeball match simulator

This simulator show the simple basketball game website monitoring.

The goal was to learn more about NodeJs, backend + frontend and connect it together by API.

It has two main parts:
1. Backend server- it serves API of a game.
2. Frontend website- that renders backend data.
